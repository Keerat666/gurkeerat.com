  Coding itself is an art, and there is no place in the software development lifecycle that is funnier and more amusing than a Pull Request chain filled with comments. My journey with Aristo began as an exploration of the intersection between coding, technology, and human creativity. I was inspired by the ever-evolving landscape of software development and the opportunities to enhance the developer experience.

Aristo, is an AI bot designed to streamline the code review process. It can analyze code in any programming language and promptly share its insights by leaving comments directly on open pull requests. Aristo acts as a senior developer, reviewing code and providing feedback to engineers within minutes. It automates basic-level checks, saving valuable time for developers and improving code quality.

I was already familiar with Atlassian's world, thanks to contract work at a startup called Rivi during my final year. And I have also been using Jira since the time I stepped into corporate.

The thrill of the hackathon inspired a crazy but fun idea. I embarked on the development of Aristo using Large Language Models (LLMs) as the foundation. To make Aristo relatable to the Gen Z audience, we had initially named it as Aristotle but later opted for Aristo. The project is made using Forge, which allowed us to build fully-functional apps within BitBucket quickly with hosting, multiple development environments, and built-in API authentication.

For the backend, I developed a Node.js service that serves as the brain of Aristo. For the frontend there are 2 parts. The first is a Forge App inside of Bitbucket. And, the second is a React web app.

The journey of building Aristo has been a profound learning experience. I've gained insights into the complexities of code review, the significance of scalability and maintainability, and the delicate balance between automation and human touch in software development. My exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential for code analysis has deepened my understanding of Generative AI!

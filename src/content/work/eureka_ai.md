Eureka AI personalizes the learning experience by letting you chat with iconic figures on any topic that sparks your curiosity, all for free. Be ready to unlock your potential through engaging conversations with the best minds, real or imagined.

It currently has a few celebrities based AI that you can chat with. Some of them are Snoop Dogg, SRK, T Swift, Hermoine and many more. I have added some fun characters like Groot and Yoda too to have some fun.

I built it using the Gemini AI. Gemini AI plays a very big role in the application. The rest part of it is handled by Node JS and React. I am also using a Database called TiDb to store the celebrities that Eureka is offering.

I have a vision that Eureka AI can use some touch of voice to give a more immersive experience to the user. Like imagine having an actual conversation about a topic with a virtual version of you favourite celeb on the topic of your choice.

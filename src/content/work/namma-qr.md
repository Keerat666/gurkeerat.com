description: The idea is for users to walk out of a location, scan a QR code on the nearest auto using the Namma Yatri app, and instantly start their ride without any delays.

To cater to drivers' preferences, a functionality is included in the app allowing them to toggle between accepting instant rides or not. This feature benefits both customers and drivers by providing quick rides for either short or long distances, saving time and fuel. Additionally, drivers can gain insights into popular areas for instant rides, enabling them to locate potential customers more effectively.

To address instances where multiple individuals approach the same auto, a first-come, first-served priority system is implemented. When a customer initiates an instant ride booking, their nearest auto is locked exclusively for them for the next 5 minutes, preventing others from booking the same auto during that time.

The solution includes an MVP with a mocked backend using Express.js and MongoDB, incorporating dynamic QR code generation for each auto. The frontend utilizes React Native to create a user-friendly experience across iOS, Android, and web platforms. The UX is designed to be simple and accessible for a broad target audience ranging from 15 to 65 years old.

By leveraging technology and QR codes, the proposed module enhances the Namma Yatri app's capabilities, envisioning a future where instant rides become the norm, saving time and enhancing convenience for commuters in busy cities.

This project won me the first prize at the Namma Yatri Open Mobility Challenge powered by Juspay and ONDC.

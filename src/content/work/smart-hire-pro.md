## Smart Hire Pro

I've developed a suite of AI-powered APIs to streamline and improve the recruitment process for HR professionals. These APIs leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate tasks and enhance decision-making.

The Job Description Evaluation API analyzes job descriptions and offers suggestions for clarity and effectiveness, leading to better candidate attraction.

The CV Ranking and Shortlisting API ranks candidates' resumes based on job requirements, saving HR professionals time by prioritizing the most qualified applicants.

The Candidate Interview Prompt Generation API creates tailored interview questions based on each candidate's profile and the job role, enabling more in-depth evaluations.

This comprehensive solution empowers HR teams to make informed hiring decisions while saving valuable time through automation and improved recruitment workflows.

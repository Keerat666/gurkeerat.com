I created Nutrilens along with Adarsh and Ishaan to address the challenges faced by individuals with food allergies. The name of our team was 10x Develoeprs and the app is made in a way that puts your health first. Simply scan any food item, and Nutrilens instantly identifies potential allergens. Whether it's a packaged snack or a restaurant dish, we've designed Nutrilens to give you the confidence to enjoy your food without worry.

We developed Nutrilens as part of Infosys' Makeathon 17. We're proud to have won third place among 915 participants, validating the app's potential to make a real difference. Nutrilens isn't just a hackathon project; it's something that we want to develope even further and launch on the play store soon! 

I believe it can revolutionize the way people with allergies interact with food.
